# Calculus
## Part 3 - Analyzing with Derivatives

### 3.1 - Crticial Points and First Derivatives
**Critical points** are points on the graph where 
$$f'(x) = 0$$
or don't exist. They are found through the **first derivative test**, which is basically just differentiating the function.

A function is increasing where 
$$f'(x) > 0$$
and decreasing where
$$f'(x) < 0$$
. Because of this, crticial points can be maxima, minima, or neither. A **local maximum** occurs when the derivative goes from positive to negative, and a **local minimum** occurs when the derivative goes from negative to positive. In other words: a minimum or maximum occurs when
$$f''(x)$$
switches signs.

**Example:** Let's imagine that the graph below is of 
$$f'(x)$$

The critical points of
$$f(x)$$
, the parent function, would be at x = 1, 4, and 6.8. Of those critical points, the ones at x=1 and x=6.8 are minima, while the other is a maximum.

This is the corresponding graph of
$$f(x)$$

**Finding Absolute Extrema:** Absolute extrema, or global extrema, over an interval, can
be determined by plugging in the values where the ends of the domain and critical points occur.

### 3.2 - Concavity
**Concavity** is directly related to the second derivative of a function. Concavity can either be **up** or **down**.
- Upward concavity occurs where
$$f''(x) >0$$
. You can also say 
$$f'(x)$$
is increasing. Concave-up segments appear to "smile".
- Downward concavity occurs where
$$f''(x) <0$$
. You can also say 
$$f'(x)$$
is decreasing. Concave-up segments appear to "frown".

**Points of inflection** occur where the concavity changes. In other words, where
$$f''(x)$$
changes signs.

**The second derivative test** determines if the critical points indicated a minimum, maximum, or neither.
- Minimum:
$$f'(x) = 0$$
and
$$f''(x) > 0$$
- Maximum:
$$f'(x) = 0$$
and
$$f''(x) < 0$$
