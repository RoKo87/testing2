## Part 11 - Series

### 11.1 - Definition and Convergence

A **series** is a sum of terms that follow a consistent pattern. A series is represented by the capital Greek letter sigma, Σ. The notation for a series looks like this:
$$\sum_{n=i}^k f(n)$$.
𝑛 is the **index**, which startes at value 𝑖. The expression 𝑓(𝑛) is added to the total sum and 𝑛 is incremented by 1. The cycle repeats and then ends when 𝑛 is equal to 𝑘. Each addition of the cycle is called a **term**.

Other facts:
* 𝑓(𝑛) can also be called the **summand** or **argument**, and can also be represented as 
$$a_n$$.
* When the upper bound, 𝑘, is equal to ∞, the series is **infinite**.
* A **partial sum** is equivalent to the first 𝑞 terms of a series. The partial sum can be represented as 
$$S_q$$. For example, the partial sum for the first six terms (a.k.a. the sixth partial sum) can be represented as $$S_6$$.

A series **converges** when $$\lim_{k \to x} \sum_{n=i}^k f(n)$$ exists, where 𝑖 is the initial value. If not, it **diverges**.
### 11.2 - Types of Infinite Series
* A series is **geometric** when 𝑓(𝑛) can be replaced by an exponential function of 𝑛.
  * General pattern: $$\sum_{n=i}^\infty c(r)^n$$
  * Geometric series converge when |𝑟| < 1. If it converges, the series is equal to $$\frac{c(r)^i}{1-r}$$.
* A series is **harmonic** when 𝑓(𝑛) can be multiplied or divided to get 1/𝑛.
  * General pattern: $$\sum_{n=i}^\infty \frac{c}{n}$$
  * Harmonic series always diverge.
* A **power series** is a series where 𝑓(𝑛) is a power of 𝑛.
  * General pattern: $$\sum_{n=i}^\infty n^p$$
  * Geometric series converge when 𝑝 < -1.
