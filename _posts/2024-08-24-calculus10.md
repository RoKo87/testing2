# Calculus
## Part 10 -  Functions with Different Outputs

### 10.1 - Parametric Functions

A parametric function has an input that determines both the x and y values. For example:
$$f(t) = (4t^2 + 3, \sin t)$$
. In this example, the x-value is 
$$4t^2 + 3$$, and the y-value is 
$$\sin t$$

Parametric functions can be represented as a vector: 
$$\vec{v} = <x, y>$$. For now, let's imagine that the constituent expressions are functions of 𝑡 for 𝑥 and 𝑦, setting it equal to 𝑓(𝑡).

$$\vec{v} = <x(t), y(t)> = <4t^2 + 3, \sin t>$$.

For parametric equations the **slope** and the **derivative** are **different**.

The slope of a parametric function is: 
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y'(t)}{x'(t)}$$. In our example, that would be:
$$\frac{8t}{\cos t}$$

$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$$ for a parametric function is 
$$\frac{\frac{d}{dt}[\frac{dy}{dx}]}{x'(t)}$$. In our example, that would be: 
$$\frac{-8}{\sin t \cos t}$$.

The derivative of a parametric function is simply the derivative of the 𝑥- and 𝑦-function. In our example, that would be: 
$$<8t, \cos t>$$.

The **"speed"** of a parametric equation uses the Pythagorean theorem: 
$$sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2}$$

The **distance** along a segment of the curve is the integral of the speed between the bounds of the segment: 
$$\int_{t_1}^{t_2} sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2} dt$$

**Vertical tangents** occur when x'(t) = 0 and y'(t) ≠ 0.
**Horizontal tangents** occur when y'(t) = 0 and x'(t) ≠ 0.
