# Calculus
## Part 5 -  Antidifferentiation

### 5.1 - Slope Fields
**Slope fields** show the slope of every tangent line. Because showing every tangent line is
difficult, we show tiny lines representing slopes at regular intervals along the graph. The slope is determined by the differential equation (x and y are the coordinates)

Below is the slope field of the differential equation $$dy = x − y$$. For example, at (2,1) the slope is:
$$\frac {dy}{dx} = x-y$$. For example, at (2,1) the slope is:
$$x - y = 2 − 1 = 1$$.

Slope fields are useful for finding a **solution curve** to a differential equation. The derivative of the solution curve is the differential equation.
