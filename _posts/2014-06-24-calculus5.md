# Calculus
## Part 5 -  Antidifferentiation

### 5.1 - Slope Fields
**Slope fields** show the slope of every tangent line. Because showing every tangent line is
difficult, we show tiny lines representing slopes at regular intervals along the graph. The slope is determined by the differential equation (x and y are the coordinates)

Below is the slope field of the differential equation $$dy = x − y$$. For example, at (2,1) the slope is:
$$\frac {dy}{dx} = x-y$$. For example, at (2,1) the slope is:
$$x - y = 2 − 1 = 1$$.

Slope fields are useful for finding a **solution curve** to a differential equation. The derivative of the solution curve is the differential equation.

## 5.2 - Euler’s Method
Euler’s method is the process of estimating a point using multiple lines. The first line is a tangent line $$L(x)$$, starting at a value 𝑖, and after a certain step size, 𝑠, the line changes it slope
to be the $$\frac {dy}{dx}$$ value of the point $$(i + s, f(i + s))$$. The process repeats with each new line until the desired x-value is reached. For example, look at this image below.

## 5.3 - Logistic Differentials
A logistic function is a type of function
whose slope depends on the y-value’s distance between the lower and upper horizontal asymptotes, creating an S-shaped curve. The differential expression for a logistic function can be represented by
$$\frac {dy}{dx} = ky(L − y)$$ or $$kLy(1 − \frac {y}{L})$$, where 𝐿 is the carrying capacity, and 𝑘 𝑑𝑥 𝐿
is some constant. This would make the steepest point of the graph be where $$y = \frac {L}{2}$$ . If the domain were restricted past this point, the steepest point would be the start of the domain.

## 5.4 - Simple Antidifferentiation
Antidifferentiation is the opposite of differentiation: you turn a differential equation into the
solution using antidifferentiation. One thing to note is that because the constant in a solution equation will always turn into zero in a differential equation, the differential equation can turn into a set of equations using antidifferentiation. To show this, we add the **integration constant** + 𝑐
at the end of antidifferentiation problems. The symbol for antidifferentiation is: $$∫ f(x) dx$$. The function is encased with the long s and the dx. The dx means “with respect to x.”

The power rule for antidifferentiation is: $$∫ x^ndx = \frac {x^n+1}{n+1}+C$$. Like differentiation, each term is independent of another. For composite functions with a linear inside function, the result is divided by the slope of the inside function. For example, $$∫\cos(3x-5)dx = \frac {1}{3}\sin(3x-5) + c$$.

A particular solution is a specific equation from the antiderivative. If we are given a point, we can solve for 𝑐. Usually, the antiderivative of 𝑓(𝑥) is commonly represented as 𝐹(𝑥).

## 5.5 - Separation of Variables
When a differential equation can be represented as $$\frac {dy}{dx} = \frac {𝑓(𝑥)}{g(y)}$$ , we can solve for the solution 
curve using separation of variables. We can rearrange the equation using cross-multiplication, and then take the integral of both sides. This leaves us with:
$$∫f(x)dx = ∫g(y)dy$$.
We can find the solution curve and the particular solution from here.

## 5.6 - L'Hôpital's Rule:
We use l'Hôpital's rule when we are working with a limit of a fraction: $$\lim_{x \to c} \frac {f(x)}{g(x)}$$ , and if 𝑓(𝑐) and
𝑔(𝑐) both equal either 0 or $$\infty$$. L'Hôpital's rule states that if these conditions are met, the limit is equal to $$\frac {f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$

## Free-response questions notes:
- NEVER say that the limit is equal to 0 or $$\infty$$ .
- ALWAYS say that you will use l'Hôpital's rule.
- ALWAYS use limit notation for each iteration of l'Hôpital's rule.
