# Calculus
## Part 8 - Geometry with Integration

### 8.1 - Perimeter and Area

Let’s say we have two functions, 𝑓(𝑥) and 𝑔(𝑥) as shown to the right. Notice that 𝑓(𝑥) is on top, and 𝑔(𝑥). We know that we can use integration to calculate the area. The area between the curves
from 𝑎 to 𝑏 is:
$$\int_{a}^{b}𝑓(𝑥) − 𝑔(𝑥)𝑑𝑥.𝑓$$ can be any top function and 𝑔 can be any bottom function.

The **arclength** is the length of a curved line. And it can be calculated using the formula:
$$\int_{a}^{b}\sqrt{1 + 𝑓'(𝑥)^2}𝑑𝑥$$ The equation of the line is 𝑓(𝑥)

Let’s say that:
$$𝑏(𝑥) = \frac{1}{2} 𝑥^2 − 6𝑥 + 16$$ and $$𝑡(𝑥) = \frac{3}{2}\sin( \frac{\pi}{2}𝑥)+4.$$
Region R is located within these functions and the lines 𝑥 = 3 and 𝑥 = 3π.

What is the area and perimeter of R?

Area:
$$\int_{3}^{3\pi}𝑡(𝑥)−𝑏(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = \int_{3}^{3\pi}\frac{3}{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}𝑥) + 4 − (\frac{1}{2} 𝑥^2 − 6𝑥 + 16) 𝑑𝑥$$

Perimter (use arclength): 
$$[𝑡(3) − 𝑏(3)] + [𝑡(3\pi) − 𝑏(3\pi)] + \int_{3}^{3\pi} \sqrt{1 + 𝑏'(𝑥)^2} + \sqrt{1 + 𝑡'(𝑥)^2} 𝑑𝑥$$

Keep in mind that the same works for functions of y.

### 8.2 - Solids of Revolution
In some calculus problems, they rotate an area between two functions around a certain vertical or horizontal line called the **axis of rotation**. The resulting three-dimensional shape is called a **solid of revolution**. The cross-sections of all of these are circles. The axis of revolution is never inside the area.

So, the washer area equation can also be written as:
- $$\pi([𝐴 − 𝑓(𝑥)]^2 − [𝐴 − 𝑛(𝑥)]^2)$$, when the axis of rotation is above the area
- $$\pi([𝑓(𝑥) − 𝐴]^2 − [𝑛(𝑥) − 𝐴]^2)$$, when the axis of rotation is below the area
- where 𝑓(𝑥) is the far function and 𝑛(𝑥) is the near function.

A special instance of these solids of revolution is when the near function is the axis of symmetry. In this case, the cross-sections are called **disks** and the equation for their area is:
- $$\pi([𝐴 − 𝑓(𝑥)]^2)$$, when the axis of rotation is over the area
- $$\pi([f(x) − A]^2)$$, when the axis of rotation is under the area

Keep in mind that the same works for functions of y (above is right, below is left).

### 8.3 - Solids using Cross-Sections
For these solids, the area acts like a base, which a shape emerges out of. The cross section in the z-axis will be that shape. The shapes that are commonly used in questions are: rectangles, squares, semicircles, 45-45-90 triangles, and equilateral triangles.

The volume of these solids is:
$$\int_{a}^{b}𝐴(𝑓(𝑥)) 𝑑𝑥$$, where 𝐴(𝑥) is the area function of the relative shape, and 𝑓(𝑥) is the length across the area which might be used as a variable in the area function.

The distance across the area at a certain input-value will be defined as 𝑥 when defining the following functions.

- **Rectangle**: The base of the rectangle is the distance across the area (𝑥), while the height may be fixed or proportional to the base.
    - $$𝐴(𝑥) = 𝑥h$$ (where height is fixed)
    - $$𝐴(𝑥) = kx^2$$ (where the ratio of height to base is 𝑘:1).
- **Square**: One side is 𝑥
    - $$A(x) = x^2$$
- **Semicircle**: The flat side is attached to the xy-plane (the base).
    - $$𝐴(𝑥)=\frac{\pi}{2}(\frac{x}{2})^2=\frac{2\pi+𝑥^2}{4}$$
- **45-45-90 Triangle**: This can also be called an **isosceles right triangle**. The hypotenuse is attached to the xy-plane (the base).
    - $$A(x)=\frac{x^2}{2}$$
- **Equilateral Triangle**: Since all sides are equal, any side can be the base.
    - $$𝐴(𝑥) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} 𝑥^2$$

The volume of the solids is always calculated by:

$$\int_{a}^{b}𝐴(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥$$, where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are the original bounds of the area.

Keep in mind that the same works for functions of y.
