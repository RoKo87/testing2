# Calculus
## Part 4 -  Implicit Differentiation

### 4.1 - Intro to Implicit Differentiation
**Implicit differentiation** is finding the derivative of an equation with two variables on one side.
The derivative of y, with respect to x, is represented as 𝑑𝑦/dx or 𝑦'. We are treating y as a 𝑑𝑥
relationship of x. 𝑑𝑦/dx is another way to say 𝑓'(𝑥) (y is a function of x).

Differentiate normally, but for every y-term, **use the chain rule**, with y being a function of x:
$$[𝑎𝑦^𝑛]'=𝑛𝑎𝑦^{𝑛−1}· \frac {𝑑𝑦} {dx},[\sin 𝑦]'= \cos 𝑦· \frac {𝑑𝑦}{dx},[𝑥^2+𝑦]'=2𝑥+1· \frac {𝑑𝑦}{dx}$$

You see that $$\frac {dy}{dx}$$ is multiplied to each derived y-term
Ex:
$$\frac {d}{dx}[6x^2 - 4xy + 10y^2 - 2x + 6y = 7] = 12x - 4xy\frac{dy}{dx} + 20y\frac {dy}{dx} - 2 + 6\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
From here, you can find the value of $$\frac {dy}{dx}$$

$$12x-4xy \frac {dy}{dx} +20y \frac {dy}{dx}-2+6\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
$$12x-2=4xy\frac{dy}{dx}-20y\frac{dy}{dx}-6\frac{dy}{dx}$$
$$12x-2=\frac{dy}{dx}(4xy-20y-6)$$
$$\frac{12x-2}{4xy-20y-6}=\frac{dy}{dx}$$

Once again, from here, you can find the value of $$\frac {d^2y}{dx^2}$$ by plugging in the known value of $$\frac {dy}{dx}$$
The slope of an implicit curve is $$\frac {𝑑𝑦}{dx}$$. A **tangent line** is a line touching a point of a function with a 𝑑𝑥
slope equal to the derivative of the x-value of that point. Horizontal tangent lines are where $$dy=0$$ and vertical tangent lines are where $dx = 0$ ($dy$ is the numerator and $dx$ is the denominator).

### 4.2 - Linear Approximation
**Linear approximation** is simply estimating the point of a graph at a given input value using a tangent line of a curve.

For example: Estimate $f(2. 1)$ for $f(𝑥) = x^3 − 3x$, center at $x = 2$

Find the tangent line at the centered value: $y = 2 + 9(x − 2)$

And plug in the actual x-value:$y = 2 + 9(2.1 − 2) = 2.9$

An overestimate will occur when the curve is concave down.

An underestimate will occur when the curve is concave up.

### 4.3 - Related Rates Problems
Problems with related rates use implicit equations to model a real-life scenario. Some relationships are given, while some need to be found to answer the question (usually the rate of change of something)

Example: Air is pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 5 cm3/min. When the radius is 10 cm, how fast is the radius moving? The formula for a sphere’s volume is $V = 4π𝑟^3$.

1. Find what relationships and values are known
$$V = 4π𝑟^3, 𝑉' = 5, 𝑟 = 10$$
2. Take the derivative to find the rate of change (usually a known formula), plugging in
known values
$$𝑉' = 12π𝑟2𝑟' = 1200π𝑟' = 5$$
3. Solve.
$$1200π𝑟' = 5$$
$$𝑟'= \frac {5} {1200π}$$

For rate of change problems involving cones, replace the radius as a relationship of height. For example if $\frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{3}$ ,then $\frac{1}{3} π𝑟^2h = \frac{1}{3} π(\frac{2}{3} h)^2h = \frac {2}{9} πh^3$,

For shadow problems, use the concept of similar triangles.
