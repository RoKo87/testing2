# Calculus
## Part 9 -  Integration Methods

### 9.1 - Product Integral

The integral of a product can be solved using three methods:
- **U-substitution (u-du Integration)** (subsection 6.3)
- **Using algebra before integrating.**
- **Integration by Parts (u-dv Integration)** NEW!

This is the expanded formula for the integration by parts method (derived from the product rule)

$$𝑓(𝑥)𝑔(𝑥) = \int𝑓'(𝑥)𝑔(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 + \int𝑓(𝑥)𝑔'(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥$$

Replace: $$u = f(x)$$, $$u’ = f’(x)$$, $$v = g(x)$$, $$v’ = g’(x)$$

$$uv = \int u'v + \int uv'$$

If we shift the first term to the other side, we get the common formula.

$$\int uv'=uv−\int u'v$$ or $$\int udv=uv−\int vdu$$

But technically, any of the two functions can be 𝑢 or 𝑑𝑣. We can assign each variable to each function wisely by using the mnemonic: **I LATE**
- **I**nverse Trig (best for u)
- **L**ogarithms
- **A**lgebra (Power functions)
- **T**rig Functions
- **E**xponents (best for dv)

We can use the **table method** for repeated u-dv Integration:

For example, the function $$𝑔(𝑥) = \int\frac{4}{3} x^3\sin(2𝑥) 𝑑𝑥$$

After filling out the table, multiply each column (except the iteration one) for each term.
$$g(x)=-\frac{2}{3}x^3\cos(2x)+x^2\sin(2x)+x\cos(2x)-\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)$$

### 9.2 - Quotient Integral
The integral of a quotient can be solved using two methods:
- **Using algebra before integrating**, this includes polynomial division.
- **Power rule**, for special fractions
- **Partial Fractions (A-B method)** NEW! (used when the denominator is bigger)

Let’s say we are integrating this function:
$$\int \frac {3x}{x^2-3x-28}$$, we are going to be using the A-B method

1. The denominator needs to be factorable (if so, factor it out!)
    - $$\int \frac {3x}{(x+4)(x-7)}$$
2. Split the fraction into two. Each fraction should have one of the factors in the denominator and unknown values, A and B in the numerator.
    - $$\int \frac{3x}{(x+4)(x-7)} = \int \frac {A}{(x+4)} + \frac {B}{(x-7)}$$
3. Multiply the fractions by the denominator and remove the integral, A and B should be multiplied by the opposite factor
    - $$3𝑥=𝐴(𝑥−7)+𝐵(𝑥+4)$$
4. Solve for A and B by setting x to a value where one term on the right will be zero.
    - $$x=-4: -12=A(-11)+B(0) -> -12 =-11A -> A=\frac {12}{11}$$
    - $$x=7:21=A(0)+B(11) -> 21=11B->B=\frac {21}{11}$$
5. Set up an integral with the split fractions, plugging in A and B and solve.

    - $$\int \frac {A}{x+4} + \frac {B}{x-7} = \int \frac {12/11}{x+4} + \frac {21/11}{x-7}$$

    - $$\int \frac {12/11} {x+4} + \int \frac {21/11} {x-7} = \frac {12}{11} = \frac {12}{11} ln|𝑥+4|+ \frac {21}{11} 𝑙𝑛|𝑥−7|+𝑐$$

Using the A-B method, the answers are going to follow this pattern:
$$A ln |a| + B ln |b| = \int \frac {A}{a} + \int \frac {B}{b}$$

Another method will be discussed in subunit 9.4

### 9.3 - Improper Integration
There are two ways a definite integral can be **improper**.

1. If at least one of the bounds goes towards infinity or negative infinity
2. If, within the bounds, the original function is discontinuous or undefined anywhere.

An example of case 1 is: $$\int_{2}^{\infty }3\sqrt{x}$$
An example of case 2 is: $$\int_{0}^{3}\frac {2}{\sqrt{x}}$$

Where working with an improper integral, we integrate normally, except we evaluate one bound, where the case takes place, as a limit. The limit decides if the integral is confined to a certain value (**converges**) or goes towards positive or negative infinity (**diverges**). A diverging integral means that the integral **does not exist**.

In some case 2 integrals, you have to split the integral so that one of the bounds is the point where the function is discontinuous or undefined.

For example:

### 9.4 - Other Techniques
$$\sqrt {a^2-x^2}$$ 
is the curve for a upward semicircle on the x-axis with a radius of 𝑎.
$$\int\frac{1}{(x-h)^2+1}dx = \tan^{-1}(x-h)$$: 
These are usually found in “completing the square” problems.
$$\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2-(x-h)^2}}dx = \sin^{-1}[\frac{1}{a}(x-h)]$$
$$\intln(x)dx = xln(x) - x$$
$$\int \log_{n}(x)dx=x\log_{n}(x) - \frac {x}{ln(n)}$$

**Don’t forget the +c! (in indefinite integrals)**
