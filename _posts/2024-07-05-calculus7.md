# Calculus
## Part 7 - Accumulation

### 7.1 - Second Fundamental Theorem
The **Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** uses an accumulation function, where x is one of the bounds of integration.

$$[\int_{x}^{a}𝑓(𝑡)𝑑𝑡]' =𝑓(𝑥)$$, where a is a constant

The second fundamental theorem can be extended if one of the bounds of integration is a function:
$$[\int_{a}^{g(x)}𝑓(𝑡) 𝑑𝑡]' = 𝑓(𝑔(𝑥))·𝑔'(𝑥)$$, which uses chain rule

if $$𝑔(𝑥) = \int_{a}^{x}𝑓(𝑡) 𝑑𝑡, 𝑔'(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥)$$, this is commonly used in graph FRQ problems.

## 7.2 - Rates to Accumulation
Integrals convert rates to the accumulation of the rates. The First fundamental theorem can be rearranged like this:
$$𝑓(𝑎)+\int_{a}^{b}𝑓'(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 =𝑓(𝑏)$$
This says that a starting point plus the accumulation of the rate from start to end equals the ending point. The accumulation of the rate is equal to the total change.
If we have a rate in 𝑖'(𝑥) and a rate out 𝑜'(𝑥), we can combine those rates to find the overall rate 𝑟'(𝑥).
- $$i(x) − o(x) = r(x)$$
- $$\int_{a}^{b}𝑖'(𝑥) − 𝑜'(𝑥) = \int_{a}^{b}𝑟'(𝑥) = 𝑟(𝑏) − 𝑟(𝑎)$$
