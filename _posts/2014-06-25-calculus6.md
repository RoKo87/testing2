# Calculus
## Part 6 -  Intro to Integration

### 6.1 - Riemann Sums
**Riemann sums** approximate the area of a curve between it and the x-axis for a given range by splitting the data into rectangular or trapezoidal chunks. The more splits there are, the more accurate the approximation is. The space between the edges of the rectangles, ∆𝑥, doesn’t have to be equal. Let’s say that the edges of the splits are 𝑥1 and 𝑥2.

- **Left Sums**: Rectangles that extend out from a point touching the left of a rectangle
    - Formula: $$\sum f(x_1)\delta x$$
- **Right Sums**: Rectangles that extend out from a point touching the right of a rectangle
    - Formula: $$\sum f(x_2)\delta x $$
- **Midpoint Sums**: Rectangles that extend out from a point touching the middle of a rectangle
    - Formula: $$\sum f(\frac {x_1+x_2} {2} )\delta x $$
- **Trapezoidal Sums**: Trapezoids that are flat at the bottom but slanted at the top according to the graph
    - Formula: $$\sum \frac {f(x_1)+f(x_2)} {2} \delta x $$

For an increasing function, left sums underestimate and right sums overestimate. 
For a decreasing function, left sums overestimate and right sums underestimate. 
For a concave-up function, trapezoidal sums overestimate.
For a concave-down function, trapezoidal sums underestimate.

### 6.2 - Definite Integrals and the First Fundamental Theorem
So far, we know how to solve for **antiderivatives**, which are also known as **indefinite integrals**.
On the other hand, **definite integrals** are the area of a function within certain boundaries (the slope and the area of a function are direct opposites). They can be calculated similarly to indefinite integrals. Usually, the antiderivative of 𝑓(𝑥) is commonly represented as 𝐹(𝑥).

$$\int^b_a f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$$.
There are also some integral properties.

$$\int^a_b f = -\int^b_a f,\int^b_a kf = k\int^b_a f,\int^b_a f(x) + \int^b_a g(x) = \int^b_a f(x) + g(x)$$

The **First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** connects the concepts of integration and differentiation:
$$\int^b_a f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a)$$

Another formula: **Average value of an interval:** $$[\int^b_a f(x) dx]/(b-a)$$

### 6.3 - U-Substitution
**U-substitution** is the opposite of the derivative chain rule
  Review: The chain rule states that $$[f(g)]' = f'(g).g'$$

U-substitution states that $$\int f'(g(x) · g'(x) dx = f(g(x). The f'(g(x) may not be obvious at first
when actual values are given. To make it easier, we will replace g(x) with a variable u.

$$\int f'(u).\frac{du}{dx} dx = \int f'(u)du = f(u) = f(g(x))$$
We can use arthimetic on the $$dx$$ and $$du$$ terms. This shows that $$du = u' dx$$

Sometimes the $$g'(x)$$ can be multiplied or divided by a constant $$k$$, in this case:
$$\int f'(u) . ku' dx = k[\int f'(u)du] = kf(u) = k . f(g(x))$$

### 6.4 - Writing Integrals as Limits
As the width of rectangles for a Riemann sum gets smaller, we get closer to the true value of an integral. Therefore, an integral can be written as a limit using this formula:

$$\int^b_a f(x) dx = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \sum f(x_i) \Delta x = \lim_{n \to in f.} \sum ^n_{k=1} [f(a + \frac {(b-a)k}{n})][\frac {b-a}{n}]$$
