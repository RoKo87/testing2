# Calculus
## Part 6 -  Intro to Integration

### 6.1 - Riemann Sums
**Riemann sums** approximate the area of a curve between it and the x-axis for a given range by splitting the data into rectangular or trapezoidal chunks. The more splits there are, the more accurate the approximation is. The space between the edges of the rectangles, ∆𝑥, doesn’t have to be equal. Let’s say that the edges of the splits are 𝑥1 and 𝑥2.

- **Left Sums**: Rectangles that extend out from a point touching the left of a rectangle
    - Formula: $$\sigma f(x_1)\delta x$$
- **Right Sums**: Rectangles that extend out from a point touching the right of a rectangle
    - Formula: $$\sigma f(x_2)\delta x $$
- **Midpoint Sums**: Rectangles that extend out from a point touching the middle of a rectangle
    - Formula: $$\sigma f(\frac {x_1+x_2} {2} )\delta x $$
- **Trapezoidal Sums**: Trapezoids that are flat at the bottom but slanted at the top according to the graph
    - Formula: $$\sigma \frac {f(x_1)+f(x_2)} {2} \delta x $$

For an increasing function, left sums underestimate and right sums overestimate. 
For a decreasing function, left sums overestimate and right sums underestimate. 
For a concave-up function, trapezoidal sums overestimate.
For a concave-down function, trapezoidal sums underestimate.
